<article>
    <p> I grew up on a farm in rural North East Victoria near, Albury/Wodonga. I am the youngest out of my siblings, I have two older brothers that are currently studying tertiary studies. I was born in Australia, and I have completed my year 12 studies. I have a wide range of hobbies, some of which include: Playing video games, I also have a strong interest in most things to do with technology and computers. I also have a hobby of sporting shooting, specifically clay targets and biathlon, to which I held champion for a number of years. I also enjoy 4x4ing and hiking. My greatest hiking achievement was completing ‘The Overland track’ in a blizzard. During my studies through high school I took up a casual job at Buller Wines to which I would often work holidays and some public holidays at, it was here where I picked up a work ethic. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;font-size:150%;text-shadow: 2px 1px purple;"><b>My Intrest For IT</b></h3>

<article>
  <p>My interest in IT sparked when I first held an Ipad when I was young. My mum stood in line for 8hours the day the first Ipad was released so that she could get my brothers and I one. The parts of IT that interest me include:
  </p>
  <p><strong>Programing: </strong>
    Ever since year 6 i have taken a strong interest in programming and how applications and games are made. I completed a short intro course in year 6 for python programming and an extensive course on a program on scratch. Since then I have tried using game engines such as Unity and Unreal engine to create games of my own. I am currently taking an online course through Unity to complete, an accreditation for basic C# coding for unity. </p>

  <p><strong>Understanding errors:</strong>
During my high school years, I spent a while trying to understand how technology works and how to fix errors on my own without having to go to IT. After spending time with my school's IT department I learnt how to fix the most common errors on both Ipads, laptops and a limited amount for projectors. </p>

  <p><strong>Having a knowledge base:</Strong>
The main interest for why I want to learn IT is so that I can make a career in IT and possibly branch off into making games for a living. I have high ambitions for a game career as Australia has a limited amount of game companies residing here. But An IT course will benefit my knowledge as it will grant me further insights into how general applications are made and how the world of computers work. To me, this is an important thing that everyone should undertake as the IT field is only going to grow further as the Expansion of technology is only increasing faster than ever before. </p>

  <p>Besides, when I first held an Ipad, there was only one other thing that sparked my interest in IT. The story of Elon Musk has always given me an inspiration that with hard work and time all things can eventually be done. I only have very limited experience in IT as I have come straight from high school into University. The only experience I have in the field is basic C# programing knowledge, a basic understanding of Python, and a larger understanding of Vex robotics as I was a part of it for 3 years in high school and took it as a year 10 elective. Through the Vex program, I learned how to control a robot through both graphical and physical C++ and python coding. However, when it comes to professional experience for IT I do not have any. </p>

  <p>During year 12 I had my eyes always set on either RMIT or the university of Queensland as I took an interest in them both. I was not sure as to the course I wanted to do at the Universities as I had not made up my mind. The final choice for me to come to RMIT was decided when I received an offer for engineering of which I accepted and then declined when I was offered a place in IT. Ultimately my desired course was game design but in hindsight, I believe that IT will benefit me more as it is giving me a broader understanding. The parts of RMIT that attracted me were the location of the campus and the easability to navigate their website and program structures. I also have an older brother who is just starting his Masters in Architecture, this influenced me to come to RMIT as I have someone that I know that goes here. </p>

  <p>During my studies, I expect to learn about a broad range of technology concepts. I hope that I will learn extensively how to code in Python and touch onto C# coding as games take a heavy interest to me. I also hope that a chunk of time will be spent on mobile application development as well as a large focus on maintaining application performance and debugging. I expect that I will come out of the course with the ability to sufficiently write a program that can serve a purpose and be able to perform. I also hope that I will be able to understand Most IT concepts into computer Errors and be able to fix my computer when something goes wrong.</p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 1px purple";>What do the results of these tests mean?</h2>
  <p>To me, the results of the tests show that I am capable of working in a team with others and have the confidence to be able to take a ‘leap of faith. The results show that I have an ‘Euntrapenur’ style to life, which comes with a trade off of being mildly impatient and having an unstructured work style. The ‘education planner test’ shows that I prefer getting my hands dirty in practical stuff, meaning I prefer to work hands-on and learn hands-on. This feels like it is an accurate representation of my personality as I much prefer physically working on something as opposed to theoretically. The ‘truity’ test says that I am a person that can pay attention to the very small details, to me I believe this is accurate as I can pick out small imperfections easily in designs. These 3 results mean that I am capable of working in a team and completing projects at my own pace and to a high standard. </p>

  <p>These results give me an understanding of how i would behave in a team environment. They show that I will have a work hard mentality when it comes to working with others. It also influences me that I will be working at my most efficient when the whole group is pulling their weight. As an ‘Euntrapenur’ structure is a limitation for my personal goals. From learning what my behaviour would be like in a team, the conclusion I will make is that I would be able to work well in a team considering I have the freedom to work at my own pace and have limited restraints. </p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion of the results:</Strong> The results should be largely taken into account when forming a team, this is because i will prefer to work with other people who are like-minded or people who are efficient and hard working. If the factors aren't taken into account then I will become bored of the job/task quickly and lose interest. </p>

<article>
  <p><strong> What makes this job stand out?:</strong> This position would be suitable for an entry into an IT software development career or even a second or 3rd-year experience opportunity. The job will involve the development of programs to conduct certain tasks within a warehouse as well as improving pre-existing programs. The job will focus on the adjusting factors to programs rather than the creation of bone new programs. This position is appealing to me as it involves the use of robotics and automation, it also appears to be a structured job with a goal that is achievable. The job would also allow for a strong work experience as the job requires many different skills such as HTML5, Java and CSS. I believe that it is important to ensure that i can get the most amount of experience possible to increase my employability.</p>

  <p><strong> Required skills:</strong>The skills required for this job in my eyes would be to have at least 1-year of experience in HTML, Java and CSS. This is because the job appears to require both website development and coding of robots. A large skill that is stated is an analytic work approach and have good communication skills. I believe that this job would require qualifications in programming in HTML and Java in order to be considered for the job.</p>

  <p><strong> My succent skills:</strong> The skills and qualifications and experience that I currently have are limited but however are expanding. I have experience on a production line of which I have been working for 2 and a half years. I am also undertaking an IT degree at RMIT and a recognition course for programming with Unity. I have also had limited experience with both Python and HTML. The skills that I have are primarily, problem-solving skills, teamwork, leadership and customer skills. Over the next few years, i hope to expand the qualifications and experience that I have.</p>

  <p><strong> How I will obtain the skills: </Strong> The way I plan to obtain the skills required for this job will be to complete my degree at RMIT.  Ensure that I have a part-time job during my studies and complete further programming courses online that are recognised nationally.  The main factor to help build the skills that will be required will be getting part-time jobs, I will try to aim for IT part-time jobs where the firms can teach me further about the world of IT and help me improve my skills as a team worker as well as an individual worker. </p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;font-size:150%;text-shadow: 2px 1px purple;">Project idea</h4>
  <p>The project idea i have come up with is An app that allows RMIT students to easily find their classes in their buildings through an Augmented reality displayed on an iPhone/android. This project will allow students and staff to view a path to their room on their mobile devices. Eg. if a student cannot find room 42 in building 12 then the app will direct a path from wherever they are standing to the selected room. Through this app, it will dramatically decrease the confusion for students trying to find new rooms/ lecture theatres as it will be on a map similar to google maps street view.</p>

  <p>The motivation for me to come up with the idea of this project was because when i first walked into the RMIT buildings I was completely lost and had little to no idea as to where my rooms were that I had to attend. Most of the people I met and saw were in the exact same situation as I was and I still continue to see people struggling to find their rooms. The room numbers are easy but to the students, it's a ‘maze’ as some rooms require you to go into another building and cross back because elevators don't go high enough. Because of this, I thought that an app that had an AR map on it would allow students to easily find their rooms and save confusion.</p>

  <p>The project will be based primarily for an iPhone. It will be aimed to integrate the use of AR technologys and maps to create a simple pathfinding application that will allow the user to find their room given that they are withing a set area from the building. A detailed breakdown description is as follows:</p>

  <p><strong> Initial primary focus:</strong>The initial focus for the project will be for students to find their way to one specific room in one building. The reason for this initial concept is because of the restraint of the timeframe for the project to be completed in. By having a small realistic goal it will allow for a higher quality application. The goal will be to have the application to allow the user to find their way to building 8/08/82, within the building 12 ground floor. </p>

  <p><strong> Initial idea for how paths can be founded:</strong>An idea for how paths can be formed is a camera is taken around the building taking photos of certain areas that are x distance from the last photo, these photos would be collated together and ordered. From there coding would have to be done to have the application determine the quickest route to the room. The application would then access the user's camera and draw a blue line along the floor toward the locations of the photos that were taken, photos would provide a backup for if the lines failed to work. </p>

  <p>Or</p>

  <p>A 3d scan would be taken for the layout of the building and the floors would be grid referenced in XYZ, this will allow for a much higher detail for tracking. From there the points would be labelled and put into an order, when a room is selected the pathfinding aspect would run a function to select which grid coordinates will lead to the door of the room. The app would then display a blue line along the ground that will lead to the room, the lines would be connected to 1x1m squares which will make the appearance of the lines jagged but will allow for a better tracking.</p>

  <p><strong>User useability:</strong> The project will be designed around easability of use so that new students will be able to easily navigate the application. In an attempt to do this the page design will be a large focus. The layout of instructions will have to be minimal and precise. A way this could be done is through having a ‘class search’ button so if the student does not know where their room is they can search it up easily through a database. Furthermore the AR component should be a standing out colour and clearly show a path to the room that the user needs to go to, this could be done via a line that could be customised in terms of colour and width. Or could be a dotted line showing the path.</p>

  <p><strong>Further opportunities:</strong>This application will provide many opportunities for expansion in the future. It could serve to replace all RMIT maps and could be further expanded to act as a semi- replacement for class timetables.  The application could be expanded even further to accommodate the CBD of melbourne including which trams should be boarded. This will allow travelling much easier for new people to the city as they will be able to see a clear precise path in an AR function rather than just a map on a  screen. It would go into much further detail in comparison to the already existing google AR maps. The application would prove to be much more appealing than a regular map and the useability would be greatly increased.</p>

  <p><strong>Software required:</strong>Some software that would be required could include, Python as a programming language, AR toolkit, a camera to map out the building's layout, a phone to test the program on and a computer to do the programming on. Python will be the best choice for a programming language as it is a widely known language and has many opportunities to reach for help if the program gets stuck, it also is a benefit to use this programing language as IT students are already learning the language. Alternatively, Javascript could be used as it also has a large user base and can meet the needs for the project. An application like AR toolkit would provide a critcal amount of tools that would aid to speed up production of the app as it has a wide availability. Such as, GPS location tracking. This would be importing as it would determine where the user currently is. A database such as Orion would be required as well for if the program was to be launched as a full-scale application for RMIT students. Orion would be the best choice for this as there will be 1000’s of students using it on a daily basis. A program such as unity could be helpful to the production of the app as it has all of the necessary tools available within their system to allow for a full scale application to be launched on the app store. They also have a large variety of free and paid assets that could aid the speed of production. </p>

  <p><strong> Skils</strong> There will be some highly specilised skills that would be required to make this program. An AR expert would have to be brought in to consult as it is an important aspect to the application and i personally do not know how to do AR programs. There will also be a base skill presumed for basic programing in Python. Help would also have to be sought after for the database if one was created as it would possibly have to be linked to RMIT. Using online tutorials will greatly aid the understanding of how to program the application and would be the main source of help for the development stage. </p>

  <p><strong> Summarry: </strong> If the project is successful it will allow for a much greater ease of navigation within RMIT’s buildings and will reduce time needed to find rooms. The original problem will be solved by implementing a map that physically shows the user on their phone though their camera where to go and how far the room is, as opposed to the current map system which shows floor plans but not how to reach the floor and room. By using the AR map, it would always be accessible on everybody's phone and it would be much more convenient. The impact will be a great reduction of students getting lost and late students to class. </p>
